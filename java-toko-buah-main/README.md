⚠️ confusing messy code ⚠️

> hell of a messy code, in need of heavy refactoring (cause of rushing for 3 days to finish it all)

> everything is a mess to begin with actually, the database is cool enough ig

> open it with netbeans 8, netbeans 12 has an issue with jasper connection (weird)

> ask me anything

nb: i should've made this more bloated with features
and... this semester 1 repo is the ultimate reason why you shouldn't rush over your code.
